## Semantic Enrichment of QCL properties from Text
* In this work, we propopose a pipeline for an automatic generation of a knowledge graph (KG) for the QCL semiconductor laser properties from scientific literature based on a fine-tuned LLM.
* The approach entails automatic extraction of QCL prpoerties of interest form scientific literature based on a fine-tuned LLM  and population of the KG Schema with the extracted properties to generate the KG.
*  A notebook to show sample testing of the proposed llm on an abstract from a research paper with QCL properties is given [here](src/LLM/Evaluation/test.ipynb)
