# qclsKG
The qcl standards for the quantum cascade laser. 
A knowledge graph for exploring the qcl physical parameters and the corresponding opto-electronic effects. 
The main aim of this knowledge graph is to capture the various qcl designs and the corresponding optoelectronic characteristics. The qcl parameters of interest are physical parameters(the qcl design /stacking properties and thickness),optoelectronic characteristics(Temperature,Power and the laisng frequency).
