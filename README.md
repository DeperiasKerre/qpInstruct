## Automatic Knowledge Graph Generation for Properties in the Quantum Cascade Semiconductor Laser Domain
* In this work, we propopose a pipeline for an automatic generation of a knowledge graph (KG) for the QCL semiconductor laser properties from scientific literature based on a fine-tuned LLM.
* The approach entails automatic extraction of QCL prpoerties of interest form scientific literature and population of the QCL ontology model with the extracted properties to generate the KG.
